🔭 Future Features
Add mobile version of the app
Enhance the My Profile section by adding a placeholder message when the "My Missions" or "My Rockets" lists are empty (no missions joined or no rockets reserved).
Enhance the My Profile section by adding the "Cancel reservation" and "Leave Mission" buttons to the lists here. Clicking them should dispatch the actions you have already used in the main Rockets and Missions sections.
Enhance the My Profile section by adding the "Read more" button for each mission and rocket. Upon click, it should open a corresponding Wikipedia page in a new tab. NOTE - you need to get that extra Wikipedia URL from the API's payload.
